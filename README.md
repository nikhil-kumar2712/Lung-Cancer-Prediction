# ü©∫ Lung Cancer Detection

This project aims to detect **lung cancer** using two complementary approaches:  

1. **Deep Learning on CT-Scan Images** ‚Äì to classify different lung cancer types from medical images. The dataset can be found here [Link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mohamedhanyyy/chest-ctscan-images?resource=download).
2. **Traditional Machine Learning on Patient Survey Data** ‚Äì to predict lung cancer risk based on patient attributes.  

By combining imaging data with clinical data, the project demonstrates a hybrid AI system for improved diagnosis and risk prediction.

## üìÇ Dataset Description

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ CT-Scan Images Dataset  

The image dataset contains CT-Scan images from four categories:

- **Adenocarcinoma**: most common form of lung cancer (‚âà30‚Äì40% of NSCLC cases).  
- **Large Cell Carcinoma**: ‚âà10‚Äì15% of NSCLC cases.  
- **Squamous Cell Carcinoma**: ‚âà30% of NSCLC cases, generally linked to smoking.  
- **Normal**: CT-Scan images of healthy lung tissue.  

All images are in **JPG/PNG** format and resized appropriately for the model.

**Split:**  
- Training set ‚Äì 70%  
- Testing set ‚Äì 20%  
- Validation set ‚Äì 10%  

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Patient Survey Dataset (Tabular Data)  

This dataset contains patient-level features such as:  
- Age  
- Gender  
- Smoking history  
- Air pollution exposure  
- Genetic risk  
- Symptoms (coughing, fatigue, etc.)  

This tabular data is used to train classical ML algorithms to predict lung cancer presence or risk.
